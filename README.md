# sha265-hash-generator
Give me any input, either big or small and I promise you to give a fixed size output!

Wondered !! ðŸ¤” WHY SHA256 ??

PROS::

Deterministic : One specific input always maps to the specific output.

PseudoRandom : Not possible to guess the output based on the output of similar inputs.

One-Way : You cannot determine an input, if given a new output.

Collison-Resitant : 2256 neglect the possibility of having same output.
